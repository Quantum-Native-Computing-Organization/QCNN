# QCNN
This repository has the code applied in [Quantum convolutional neural network for classical data classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00661) Paper.
The original code by the author is [here](https://github.com/takh04/QCNN)


There are two ways you can run the code. One is through Python, and another one is through a notebook/collab file.

## Option_01: How do I run it on a local system/codespace/Anaconda environment?
`cd QCNN`

`pip install  -r requirements.txt`

`python result.py`

## Option_02: Run it on a notebook
Go to the **Notebook** folder and run the **QCNN_test** code with the **requirements.txt** file and existing **Result/result.txt** file

## Result
Once you run the result.py file, you will see accuracy for U_SU4_no_pooling, U_SU4,  U_SU4_1D, U_9_1D
